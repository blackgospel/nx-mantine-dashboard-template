# OmnixenonDashboard

Omnixenon Dashboard is templated dashboard displaying a matrix for statistics that each team has faced within their previous fixtures.

The dashboard works using a global tab system in which you can setup the fixtures you want to look at in a tab which is displayed in the header at the top of the viewport. This can be clicked on later when you want to switch between different fixtures.

## Development server

Run `nx serve omnidash` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
